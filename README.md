# ScheduleFullStack

This project was developed to my photographer wife so she could easily schedule appointments and have a clear view of her agenda. It was very challenging at first since I didn’t have much experience in front-end development but turns out I loved it and want to keep improving my work.
In this project I got to practice the following technologies: PostgreSQL for Data Base | Java for back-end API| Spring Boot | JPA to facilitate connections with DB | HTML:5 | CSS| JavaScript | Full Calendar Library for agenda display | Postman to test requisitions.
This may not be the last version of this project and definitely isn’t the cleanest one, but I will keep improving it and keep you updated.
